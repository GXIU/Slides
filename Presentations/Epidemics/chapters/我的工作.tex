\begin{frame}{Establishing models}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Task: Predicting the emergence of new firms over a city's space.
        \item[0.] Collect financial statements of companies and the decay of communication distances, establish the IOs of every trade and the current cross matrix;
        \item[1.] Vectorize the factors of different firms by reliance on differnet trades;
        \item[2.] Establish a dynamical matrix of size $kN\times kN$, new companies may emerge at some optimal location to take charge for urban development;
        \item[3.] simulate until it ends or a sufficiently long time;
        \item[4.] Evaluate the diversity of trades and the fitness of industrial structures.

\begin{frame}{Expecting}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Some cities' industrial structures may lead to TOC: companies harm their city when pursuiting their own benefits.
        \item Diversity of cities diverges according to the initial conditions since both the specialization and diversification exist.
        \item Emergence of new companiesâ€˜ spatial and size distribution.
    \end{itemize}
